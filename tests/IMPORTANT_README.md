# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Test Framework Status

## Current State

**Status:** 🟡 Template/Skeleton Tests - Requires Configuration

The test files in this directory are **templates** that demonstrate the testing structure but **are not yet fully functional**. They require proper mocking setup before they can run successfully.

### What's Working ✅

- ✅ **Test infrastructure** (Vitest, Playwright configs)
- ✅ **Mock data factories** (all 5 factories create test data)
- ✅ **Simple verification tests** (3/3 passing)
- ✅ **Test scripts** in package.json

### What Needs Setup 🔧

The following test files are currently **skipped** (`.skip.ts` extension) because they attempt to connect to a real PostgreSQL database:

**Unit Tests (Skipped):**
- `tests/unit/repositories/*.test.skip.ts` (9 tests)
- `tests/unit/services/*.test.skip.ts` (39 tests)
- `tests/unit/utils/conditionalLogic.test.skip.ts` (29 tests)

**Integration Tests (Skipped):**
- `tests/integration/routes/*.test.skip.ts` (30+ tests)

**E2E Tests (Skipped):**
- `tests/e2e/*.e2e.skip.ts` (20+ tests)

## Why Are Tests Skipped?

### The Problem

The test files were created as **templates** to demonstrate test structure, but they have a critical issue:

```typescript
// ❌ Problem: Repository classes import real database
import { SurveyRepository } from "../../../server/repositories/SurveyRepository";

// This tries to connect to PostgreSQL with test credentials
const repository = new SurveyRepository(mockDb);
```

**Error:** `password authentication failed for user "test"`

The Repository and Service classes import the real database connection directly from `server/db.ts`, not the mocked one passed to constructors.

---

## How to Fix Tests

### Option 1: Fully Mock Dependencies (Recommended)

Mock the database module at the top level:

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect, beforeEach, vi } from "vitest";

// Mock the entire database module
vi.mock("../../../server/db", () => ({
  db: {
    select: vi.fn().mockReturnThis(),
    insert: vi.fn().mockReturnThis(),
    where: vi.fn(),
    // ... etc
  }
}));

describe("SurveyRepository", () => {
  // Now tests use the mocked db
});
```

### Option 2: Use In-Memory SQLite

The project already has `tests/setup/testDb.ts` with SQLite. Update tests to use it:

```typescript
import { testSqlite } from "../../setup/testDb";

// Use SQLite instead of PostgreSQL
const result = testSqlite.prepare("SELECT * FROM surveys").all();
```

### Option 3: Set Up Test Database

Configure a real test PostgreSQL database:

```bash
# .env
TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://testuser:testpass@localhost:5432/poll_vault_test
```

Then run migrations:
```bash
npm run db:push
```

---

## Quick Start (Current State)

### Run Passing Tests
```bash
npm run test:unit
# ✅ 3/3 tests passing (simple verification tests)
```

### Re-enable Template Tests

To work on fixing a test, rename it from `.skip.ts` to `.test.ts`:

```bash
# Example: Enable SurveyRepository tests
mv tests/unit/repositories/SurveyRepository.test.skip.ts \
   tests/unit/repositories/SurveyRepository.test.ts

# Then fix the mocking and run
npm run test:unit
```

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Choose Your Approach**
   - For true unit tests: Use Option 1 (mock everything)
   - For integration tests: Use Option 3 (test database)
   - For quick prototyping: Use Option 2 (SQLite)

2. **Start Small**
   - Pick one test file (e.g., `conditionalLogic.test.skip.ts`)
   - Implement the missing functions or add proper mocks
   - Get it passing
   - Repeat for other files

3. **Update Documentation**
   - Remove this file once tests are working
   - Update main `TESTING_FRAMEWORK.md` with final status

4. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Add GitHub Actions workflow
   - Run tests on every push
   - Report coverage

## Test Scripts Available

```bash
npm test                  # Run all tests with coverage
npm run test:unit         # Unit tests only  ✅ 3 passing
npm run test:integration  # Integration tests (all skipped)
npm run test:e2e          # E2E tests (all skipped)
npm run test:watch        # Watch mode
npm run test:ui           # Interactive UI
```

## Why Were Templates Committed?

The test framework was scaffolded to demonstrate:

1. **Proper Structure** - How to organize tests by type
2. **Naming Conventions** - User story mapping (US-C-004, etc.)
3. **Factory Pattern** - Consistent test data generation
4. **Best Practices** - AAA pattern, descriptive names, isolation

These templates serve as **blueprints** for when you're ready to implement actual tests. They show what a complete test suite would look like.

---

## Questions?

- **Why not delete skipped tests?** They're valuable templates showing test structure
- **When will they work?** After adding proper mocking or test database setup
- **Are factories working?** Yes! All 5 factories create test data correctly
- **Can I add new tests?** Absolutely! Use the templates as examples

---

## Summary

**Current:** 🟡 3/3 passing (simple tests only)
**Potential:** 🎯 100+ tests once mocking is configured
**Action Required:** Choose mocking strategy and implement

The infrastructure is ready - tests just need proper database mocking!
