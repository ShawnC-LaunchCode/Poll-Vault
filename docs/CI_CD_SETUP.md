# CI/CD Setup Guide for Poll-Vault

This guide explains how to configure automated testing and deployment for Poll-Vault using GitHub Actions and Railway.

## üéØ Overview

The CI/CD pipeline automatically:
1. ‚úÖ Runs unit and integration tests (Vitest + Supertest)
2. ‚úÖ Runs E2E tests (Playwright)
3. ‚úÖ Generates code coverage reports
4. ‚úÖ Performs type checking (TypeScript)
5. ‚úÖ Builds the application
6. ‚úÖ Deploys to Railway (only on successful tests to `main` branch)

## üìã Prerequisites

- GitHub repository with Poll-Vault code
- Railway account with deployed Poll-Vault service
- Neon PostgreSQL database (can be same as production or separate test database)

## üîß GitHub Secrets Configuration

You need to add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:

### How to Add Secrets:
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **Secrets and variables** ‚Üí **Actions**
3. Click **New repository secret**
4. Add each of the following secrets:

### Required Secrets:

#### 1. `DATABASE_URL`
Your Neon PostgreSQL connection string for testing.

```
postgresql://username:password@host/database?sslmode=require
```

**Recommendation:** Use a separate test database or schema to avoid affecting production data during CI runs.

#### 2. `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
Your Google OAuth2 server-side client ID.

```
1234567890-abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.apps.googleusercontent.com
```

#### 3. `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
Your Google OAuth2 client-side (web) client ID.

```
1234567890-abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.apps.googleusercontent.com
```

#### 4. `SESSION_SECRET`
A strong random secret for session management (minimum 32 characters).

Generate one using:
```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

#### 5. `RAILWAY_TOKEN`
Your Railway account API token.

To get your Railway token:
1. Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app/account/tokens)
2. Click **Create Token**
3. Give it a name (e.g., "GitHub Actions CI/CD")
4. Copy the token value

#### 6. `RAILWAY_SERVICE_ID`
Your Poll-Vault service ID in Railway.

To find your service ID:
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm i -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Link to your project
railway link

# List services and get the ID
railway service
```

Or find it in the Railway dashboard URL:
```
https://railway.app/project/{PROJECT_ID}/service/{SERVICE_ID}
```

#### 7. `CODECOV_TOKEN` (Optional)
Token for uploading coverage reports to Codecov.

- Sign up at [codecov.io](https://codecov.io)
- Link your GitHub repository
- Copy the repository upload token

## üöÄ Railway Configuration

The `.railway.toml` file is already configured with:

```toml
[build]
builder = "NIXPACKS"
buildCommand = "npm ci && npm run build"

[deploy]
startCommand = "npm start"
restartPolicyType = "ON_FAILURE"
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 10

[env]
NODE_ENV = "production"
PORT = "5000"

[healthcheck]
path = "/api/health"
interval = 30
timeout = 10
```

### Railway Environment Variables

In your Railway project dashboard ‚Üí **Variables** tab, ensure these are set:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=<your-production-postgres-url>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<oauth-client-id>
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<web-oauth-client-id>
SESSION_SECRET=<secure-32-char-string>
ALLOWED_ORIGIN=your-app.up.railway.app
SENDGRID_API_KEY=<optional>
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
```

## üîÑ How the Pipeline Works

### Trigger Events:
- **Push to `main` or `develop`**: Runs full test suite + deploys (main only)
- **Pull Request to `main` or `develop`**: Runs full test suite (no deployment)

### Pipeline Stages:

#### 1. **Test Job** (Runs on Node 18.x and 20.x)
- Checkout code
- Install dependencies
- Type checking with TypeScript
- Run unit and integration tests
- Build the application

#### 2. **Coverage Job** (Runs on Node 20.x)
- Generate detailed coverage report
- Upload to Codecov (if configured)
- Enforce coverage thresholds:
  - Lines: 80%
  - Functions: 80%
  - Branches: 75%
  - Statements: 80%

#### 3. **E2E Tests Job** (Runs on Node 20.x)
- Install Playwright browsers
- Run end-to-end tests
- Upload Playwright HTML report as artifact (available for 30 days)

#### 4. **Deploy Job** (Only on `main` push after all tests pass)
- Install Railway CLI
- Deploy to Railway production environment
- Uses Railway's native deployment system

### Blocking Conditions:

Deployment is **blocked** if:
- ‚ùå Any unit/integration test fails
- ‚ùå E2E tests fail
- ‚ùå TypeScript type checking fails
- ‚ùå Code coverage is below thresholds
- ‚ùå Build process fails
- ‚ùå Not pushing to `main` branch

## üß™ Running Tests Locally

```bash
# Run all tests (unit + integration)
npm run test:integration

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run E2E tests with UI
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run the full CI test suite locally
npm run ci:test

# Type checking
npm run check
```

## üìä Viewing Results

### GitHub Actions:
- Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
- View workflow runs, logs, and artifacts
- Download Playwright reports for failed E2E tests

### Coverage Reports:
- Local: Open `coverage/index.html` in browser
- Codecov: View at `https://codecov.io/gh/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO`

### Railway Deployments:
- Check deployment status in Railway dashboard
- View logs: `railway logs`
- Monitor via Railway CLI or web interface

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Tests Fail in CI but Pass Locally:

**Common causes:**
- Missing environment variables in GitHub Secrets
- Database connection issues (check `DATABASE_URL`)
- Different Node.js versions (CI uses 18.x and 20.x)

**Solution:**
```bash
# Test with the same Node version as CI
nvm use 20
npm run ci:test
```

### Playwright Tests Fail:

**Common causes:**
- Missing browser dependencies
- Timeout issues in CI environment

**Solution:**
- Increase timeouts in `playwright.config.ts`
- Check Playwright report artifact in GitHub Actions

### Railway Deployment Fails:

**Common causes:**
- Invalid `RAILWAY_TOKEN` or `RAILWAY_SERVICE_ID`
- Build errors (check Railway logs)
- Missing environment variables in Railway

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify Railway connection locally
railway login
railway status

# Check environment variables
railway variables
```

### Coverage Thresholds Not Met:

**Solution:**
```bash
# Run coverage locally to see what's missing
npm run test:coverage

# View detailed HTML report
open coverage/index.html
```

Temporarily lower thresholds in `vitest.config.ts` if needed while building test coverage.

## üîÑ Optional: Nightly Test Runs

To run tests every night and catch regressions:

Create `.github/workflows/nightly.yml`:

```yaml
name: Nightly Tests

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 4 * * *" # Every day at 4 AM UTC
  workflow_dispatch: # Allow manual trigger

jobs:
  test:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/ci.yml
    secrets: inherit
```

## üìù Best Practices

1. **Never commit secrets** to the repository
2. **Use separate test database** to avoid affecting production data
3. **Run tests locally** before pushing to save CI minutes
4. **Review Playwright reports** for visual regression testing
5. **Keep dependencies updated** to avoid security vulnerabilities
6. **Monitor Railway usage** to stay within plan limits

## üéâ Verification Checklist

After setup, verify everything works:

- [ ] Push to `develop` branch triggers tests only
- [ ] Push to `main` branch triggers tests + deployment
- [ ] All test jobs pass successfully
- [ ] Coverage report is generated
- [ ] Playwright artifacts are uploaded
- [ ] Railway deployment succeeds
- [ ] Application is accessible at Railway URL

## üÜò Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check GitHub Actions logs for detailed error messages
2. Review Railway deployment logs: `railway logs`
3. Verify all secrets are correctly set
4. Test locally with the same environment variables
5. Consult the [Railway documentation](https://docs.railway.app)
