### Security Audit - npm vulnerabilities

**Status:** Tracked for later resolution

**Findings:**
- 4 moderate severity vulnerabilities detected
- Package: `esbuild` (<=0.24.2)
- Severity: Moderate
- CVE: GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99
- Issue: esbuild enables any website to send requests to the development server and read the response

**Root Cause:**
- Direct `esbuild` dependency is at v0.25.0 (not vulnerable)
- Vulnerability exists in transitive dependency chain through `drizzle-kit@0.31.5`:
  - drizzle-kit → @esbuild-kit/esm-loader → @esbuild-kit/core-utils → esbuild (vulnerable version)

**Impact:**
- Development environment only (drizzle-kit is a devDependency)
- Affects local dev server exposure
- Not a production runtime vulnerability

**Proposed Resolution Options:**
1. Wait for drizzle-kit to update their dependencies to use esbuild >=0.24.3
2. Use `npm audit fix --force` (would downgrade drizzle-kit from v0.31.5 to v0.18.1 - breaking change)
3. Monitor the drizzle-kit repository for updates

**Decision:** Option 1 - Wait for upstream fix
- Risk is low (dev-only, moderate severity)
- Avoid breaking changes from downgrading drizzle-kit
- Ensure dev server is not exposed to untrusted networks in the meantime

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Periodically check for drizzle-kit updates
- [ ] Re-run `npm audit` after updating dependencies
- [ ] Ensure development server runs on localhost only
