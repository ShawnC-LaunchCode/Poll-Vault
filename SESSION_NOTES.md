# Session Notes - 2025-10-12

## What We Accomplished

âœ… **Environment Setup:**
- Created `.env` file with secure credentials
  - Strong SESSION_SECRET generated
  - Strong POSTGRES_PASSWORD generated
  - ALLOWED_ORIGIN configured for localhost
- Verified package.json already has `cross-env` for Windows compatibility

âœ… **Identified Current State:**
- Docker not available in current environment
- Need database for persistent data
- Development servers were failing due to old package.json cache

## Next Steps (After Restart)

### Option A: Neon DB Setup (Recommended - No Docker Required)

1. **Sign up for Neon:** https://neon.tech (free tier)
2. **Create project:** "Poll-Vault"
3. **Copy connection string** (looks like):
   ```
   postgresql://username:password@ep-xxxx.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
   ```
4. **Update `.env`:** Add `DATABASE_URL=<your-connection-string>`
5. **Run migrations:** `npm run db:push`
6. **Start dev server:** `npm run dev`

### Option B: Install Docker Desktop

1. Download: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
2. Install and restart Windows
3. Run: `docker compose up -d`
4. Run migrations: `docker compose exec app npm run db:push`

## Files Modified

- `.env` - Created with secure credentials (DO NOT COMMIT)
- `package.json` - Already had cross-env (no changes needed)

## Current Project Status

According to CLAUDE.md build strategy:
- âœ… Phase 1: Foundation & Infrastructure (partially complete)
  - âœ… Database schema defined
  - âœ… Authentication system implemented
  - ðŸŸ¡ Database not yet deployed
- ðŸ”œ Phase 2: Core Survey Management (next priority)
  - Implement Survey CRUD endpoints
  - Complete Survey Builder UI
  - Add Questions Management

## Important Notes

- `.env` file contains sensitive credentials - never commit to git
- Windows environment requires `cross-env` for NODE_ENV (already configured)
- Two dev servers failed earlier - will be fixed after restart

## Recommended First Command After Restart

```bash
npm run dev
```

If it works without DATABASE_URL, you can test locally. For persistent data, complete Neon setup first.
